# ARTI 308 – Lab 2
Identifying ML Problems, Selecting Open Datasets, and Methodology Design

## Dataset
An open tabular dataset in CSV format was selected for this lab.  
The dataset contains numerical and categorical features related to house characteristics and prices.

## Machine Learning Problem
This project focuses on identifying a machine learning problem using an open dataset.  
The selected problem is a **regression task**, where the goal is to predict house prices based on the given features.

## Target Variable
House Price

## Tasks Completed
- Selected an open dataset from an open-source platform
- Identified the machine learning problem type (Regression)
- Loaded and inspected the dataset using Pandas
- Displayed dataset shape, first rows, and data types
- Designed a methodology diagram to represent the ML workflow

## Methodology Diagram
The methodology diagram illustrates the main steps of the machine learning workflow, starting from dataset selection and ending with the final results.
